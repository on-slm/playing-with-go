# Playing with Go (lang)

Just a playground for learning Go. The repo consists of:

* I went through the [Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1) - the most basic and simple tutorial for Go learning. The tutorial was made by people behind this technology.
* I tried out the [Mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) - the basic library for making routes, which goal is to enable receiving requests, for REST APIs. (No success unfortunately.)
